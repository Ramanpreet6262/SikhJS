# Poet Harbans (ਹਰਿਬੰਸ)

Poet Harbans [15th - 16th Century] was part of a group of eleven poets and singers known as Bhatts, who were all Vaishnavites, followers of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna, who had come to the congregation of Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, seeking spiritual solace. Poet Harbans wrote two hymns in praise of Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Guru. The importance of his hymns lies in describing the time when Guru Ram Das, the fourth Guru, left for his heavenly abode and Guru Arjan Dev succeeded his spiritual throne.
