# Poet Bhalh (ਭਲੇ)

Poet Bhalh [15th - 16th Century] was part of a group of eleven poets and singers known as Bhatts, who were all Vaishnavites, followers of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna, who had come to the congregation of Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, seeking spiritual solace. Poet Bhalh wrote one hymn in praise of Guru Amar Das, the third Guru. Poet Bhalh and Poet Salh were brothers, both sons of Sokha.
