# Saint Namdev (ਭਗਤ ਨਾਮਦੇਵ)

Saint Namdev [1270 - 1350] was born in the state of Maharashtra village of Naras-Vamani, in Satara district (presently called Narsi Namdev). His father was called Damshet, a tailor, and his mother was called Gonabai. The main spiritual message of Saint Namdev, just like the Sikh Gurus, was to emphasise the importance of living a married householder life and that through marriage, living in the world and meditating on God, one could attain enlightenment. Sixty-one of his hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib. He was also a close friend of Saint Trilochan.
