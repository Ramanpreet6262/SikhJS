# Saint Kabir (ਭਗਤ ਕਬੀਰ)

Saint Kabir [1440 - 1518] was a Muslim mystic born in Varanasi in India, whose 541 hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib. His writings about God are full of love and devotion, very direct and striking in appeal. The birth of Kabir remains to this day shrouded in mystery and legend. Authorities disagree on both when he was born and who his parents were. One legend proclaims a divine virginal birth. His mother was reputed to have been of the Brahman caste and to have become pregnant after a visit to a Hindu shrine. Because she was unwed, she abandoned Kabir, who was found and adopted by a Muslim weaver. That his early life began as a Muslim there is no doubt, although he later became influenced by the Hindu ascetic, Ramananda, who he accepted as his Guru.
