# Guru Nanak Dev (ਗੁਰੂ ਨਾਨਕ ਦੇਵ)

Guru Nanak Dev Ji [1469 - 1539] was the first Guru of the Sikhs born in a village named Talwandi which is now called Nankana Sahib and is in Pakistan. As a child Guru Nanak spent most of his time in isolation and meditation. He slept only for a few hours, ate small quantities of food and spoke little. One day he disappeared while having his morning bath and reappeared 3 days later and said: There is no Hindu and there is no Muslim. By saying this he meant that titles were meaningless because all of humanity is one and the light of God shines within everyone.
