# Guru Tegh Bahadur (ਮਃ ੯)

Guru Tegh Bahadur [1621 - 1675] was the ninth Guru of the Sikhs, and the son of sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib. The Guru travelled extensively in the Punjab and in other parts of the country to spread the teachings of Guru Nanak. The ruler at the time was the Moghul Emperor Aurangzeb who was forcing the Hindus to accept Islam. Some of these Hindus went to visit the Guru and ask for his help. Guru Tegh Bahadur decided to give up his life to protect the right of all people to practice whatever religion they choose. After his martyrdom, his son, Gobind, succeeded him as the tenth and final Sikh Guru.
