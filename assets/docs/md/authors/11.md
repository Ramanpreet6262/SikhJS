Saint Jaidev [circa 1200], also known as Jayadeva, whose two hymns are found in the Guru Granth Sahib is a celebrated Sanskrit poet who also wrote the Gita Govinda which describes the relationship between Krishna, Radha and the Gopis of Vrindavana. His father was Bhoidev, a Brahmin, and his mother Bamdevi. Saint Jaidev was born in Kenduli Sasan village, in the Prachi valley, Khurda district in Orissa, India. He became the most famous of the five distinguished poets, known as the five jewels, that lived in the court of Lakshman Sen, King of Bengal, who erected a monument in their honour.
