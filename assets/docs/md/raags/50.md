# Amrit Keertan ()

Amrit Kirtan is a collection of verses from Sri Guru Granth Sahib traditionally sung in the Sikh congregations. The poetry of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib is worthy of the highest consideration in singing the hymns. Music forms the basis of the rhythms and classification of the hymns of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. They follow a definite metrical system called raags. A raag in Indian classical music means a pattern of melodic notes. This form is not only used to preserve the originality of the composition, as the poetry written in this form is difficult to imitate, but more so to provide the divine experience through the medium of music and the sounds of God’s creation. The total number of ragas is 31. The gurus themselves invented some of those. Under each Raag, the hymns are arranged in different meters as Chaupadas and Ashtapadas; long poems include Chhands, Vars, and Bhagat verses. In the congregation, kirtan only of Gurbani (Guru Granth’s or Guru Gobind Singh’s hymns) and, for its elaboration, of the compositions of Bhai Gurdas and Bhai Nand Lal, may be performed..
