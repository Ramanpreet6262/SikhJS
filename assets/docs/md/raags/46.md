# Raag Maala ()

Raagmala literally means a beaded string of musical melodies. \"Mala\" means \"a beaded string\" and \"Raga\" is a \"musical composition\". It is the name given to the last composition in the Guru Granth Sahib appearing after Mundavani (riddle) and a Salok by Guru Arjan Dev. Like Japji Sahib, which appears at the beginning of the Guru Granth Sahib this composition has no heading to show the name of the author..
