# Gauri Deepaki (ਗਉੜੀ ਦੀਪਕੀ)

In the Guru Granth Sahib, there is one shabad (hymn) under the title Raag Gauri Deepaki. In this shabad, Sohila is a lorrie (lullaby), which is narrating a kind of bedtime story. <br/><br/>This Raag generates feelings of warmth and security, just like a mother singing a lullaby to her child. Lullabies were traditionally used not only as a way of comforting a child, but also as a means in which mothers shared their past experiences and knowledge.<br/><br/>Similarly this Raag enlightens the listener through knowledge and experience and brings them to the realisation that to gain the truth, you must first realise that you are in darkness. This enlightened state gives the listener a feeling of certainty, fearlessness and a new hope for the future..
