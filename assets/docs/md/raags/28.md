# Bhairao (ਭੇਰੳ)

Bhairao embodies the soul’s faith and heartfelt devotion towards The Creator. It is a kind of fanaticism, where there is a feeling of not being aware or caring about anything else. The emotions conveyed are those of contentment and of being absorbed in a steadfast belief or faith. In this Raag, the soul is relaying the happiness that the mind could potentially experience if it joined in with this devotion..
