Authorities disagree on both when he was born and who his parents were. One legend proclaims a divine virginal birth. His mother was reputed to have been of the Brahman caste and to have become pregnant after a visit to a Hindu shrine.<br\/><br\/>Because she was unwed, she abandoned Kabir, who was found and adopted by a Muslim weaver.
