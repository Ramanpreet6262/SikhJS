The Raag\u2019s origins are based in Punjabi Folk Music and its essence was inspired by the Majha regions traditions of \u2018Ausian\u2019; the game of waiting and yearning for the return of a loved one.The feelings evoked by this Raag have often been compared to that of a mother waiting for her child to return after a long period of separation. She has an anticipation and hope for the child\u2019s return, although at the same moment she is painfully aware of the uncertainty of their return home. This Raag brings to life the emotion of extreme love and this is highlighted by the sorrow and anguish of separation."},"author":{"id":1,"author":"Guru Nanak Dev","gurmukhi":"\u0a2e\u0a03 \u0a67","description":"Guru Nanak Dev Ji [1469 - 1539] was the first Guru of the Sikhs born in a village named Talwandi which is now called Nankana Sahib and is in Pakistan. As a child Guru Nanak spent most of his time in isolation and meditation. He slept only for a few hours, ate small quantities of food and spoke little.<br\/><br\/>One day he disappeared while having his morning bath and reappeared 3 days later and said: There is no Hindu and there is no Muslim. By saying this he meant that titles were meaningless because all of humanity is one and the light of God shines within everyone."},"language":{"id":54,"language":"Gurmukhi","code":"pa","script":"guru","direction":1,"accuracy":99}}]
