However, it is only when the water begins to slowly seep through their joined hands that the person comes to realise the real value and importance of the water. Similarly Raag Gujari leads the listener to realise and become aware of passing time and in this way comes to value the precious nature of time itself. The revelation brings the listener to an awareness and admission of their own death and mortality, making them utilise their remaining \u2018life time\u2019 more wisely."},"author":{"id":4,"author":"Guru Arjan Dev","gurmukhi":"\u0a2e\u0a03 \u0a6b","description":"Guru Arjan Dev [1563 - 1606] was the fifth Guru of the Sikhs, born at Goindval.
