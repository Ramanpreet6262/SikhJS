The theme of his poem, Sadu meaning call, is the ascension of Guru Amar Das, described in terms of his having been recalled by God.<br\/><br\/>The hymn states how Guru Amar Das had completely surrendered himself to the Will of the Supreme Being, ever remaining absorbed in meditation on the Name of God, how he had, through the favour of Gurus, attained the office of Guru, how he, at the time of his departure, had appointed Guru Ram Das as his successor and how he had told his family to abide by the Will of the Lord and not to weep for him after his death."},"language":{"id":54,"language":"Gurmukhi","code":"pa","script":"guru","direction":1,"accuracy":99}},{"id":39376,"text":"\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a15\u0a32\u0a40 \u0a2e\u0a39\u0a32\u0a3e \u0a6b \u0a1b\u0a70\u0a24","original":"\u0a30\u0a3e\u0a2e\u0a15\u0a32\u0a40\u0a2e\u0a39\u0a32\u0a3e\u0a6b\u0a1b\u0a70\u0a24","melody_id":1,"author_id":2,"hymn":2485,"page":924,"line":6,"section":"Ramkali","search":"\u0a30\u0a2e\u0a1b","language_id":54,"translation":{"id":669376,"scripture_id":39376,"text":"Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Chhant:","language_id":13,"language":{"id":13,"language":"English","code":"en-US","script":"latn","direction":1,"accuracy":99}},"transliteration":{"id":866251,"scripture_id":39376,"text":"r\u0101makal\u012b mahal\u0101 5 shant","language_id":69,"language":{"id":69,"language":"Latin","code":null,"script":"latn","direction":1,"accuracy":99}},"melody":{"id":1,"melody":"None","gurmukhi":"","description":"There is no melody or mood associated with this line, which may be because it is the preamble to the hymn, or is not meant to be read in any particular melody or mood"},"author":{"id":2,"author":"None","gurmukhi":"","description":"There is no author associated with this line, as it may be the preamble to the hymn"},"language":{"id":54,"language":"Gurmukhi","code":"pa","script":"guru","direction":1,"accuracy":99}},{"id":39377,"text":"\u0a74 \u0a38\u0a24\u0a3f\u0a17\u0a41\u0a30 \u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a26\u0a3f \u0965","original":"\u0a74\u0a38\u0a24\u0a3f\u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a38\u0a3e\u0a26\u0a3f\u0965","melody_id":1,"author_id":2,"hymn":2485,"page":924,"line":6,"section":"Ramkali","search":"\u0a74\u0a38\u0a2a","language_id":54,"translation":{"id":669393,"scripture_id":39377,"text":"One Universal Creator God.
