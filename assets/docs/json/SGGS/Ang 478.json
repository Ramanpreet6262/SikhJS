His writings about God are full of love and devotion, very direct and striking in appeal.<br\/><br\/>The birth of Kabir remains to this day shrouded in mystery and legend. Authorities disagree on both when he was born and who his parents were. One legend proclaims a divine virginal birth. His mother was reputed to have been of the Brahman caste and to have become pregnant after a visit to a Hindu shrine.<br\/><br\/>Because she was unwed, she abandoned Kabir, who was found and adopted by a Muslim weaver. That his early life began as a Muslim there is no doubt, although he later became influenced by the Hindu ascetic, Ramananda, who he accepted as his Guru."},"language":{"id":54,"language":"Gurmukhi","code":"pa","script":"guru","direction":1,"accuracy":99}}]
