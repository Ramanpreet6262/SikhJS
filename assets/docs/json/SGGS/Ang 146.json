The Raag\u2019s origins are based in Punjabi Folk Music and its essence was inspired by the Majha regions traditions of \u2018Ausian\u2019; the game of waiting and yearning for the return of a loved one.The feelings evoked by this Raag have often been compared to that of a mother waiting for her child to return after a long period of separation. She has an anticipation and hope for the child\u2019s return, although at the same moment she is painfully aware of the uncertainty of their return home. This Raag brings to life the emotion of extreme love and this is highlighted by the sorrow and anguish of separation."},"author":{"id":6,"author":"Guru Angad Dev","gurmukhi":"\u0a2e\u0a03 \u0a68","description":"Guru Angad Dev [1504 - 1552], originally called Bhai Lehna, was born at Harike, a small village in the Ferozepur district.
