  "description": "Kalian Bhopali’s nature is direct and insistent. Just as in Kaliyaan, this Raag conveys the feeling of determination to fulfil its desires. However, in contrast it is not flexible in its approach, as the desired goal is tackled head-on and in a regimented fashion. There is no hesitation and it is only focused on its goal.",
