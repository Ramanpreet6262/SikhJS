Poet Bhika, was originally a Brahmin poet of Sultanpur Lodhi, in present day Kapurthala district of Punjab, who joined the congregation of Guru Amar Das at Goindwal, and composed two hymns in praise of the third Guru. He later became a Sikh, receiving the rites of initiation at the hands of Guru Amar Das, and lived up to the time of Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru.
