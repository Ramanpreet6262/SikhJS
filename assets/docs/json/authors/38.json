  "description": "Poet Kirat [15th - 16th Century] was part of a group of eleven poets and singers known as Bhatts, who were all Vaishnavites, followers of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna, who had come to the congregation of Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, seeking spiritual solace. Poet Kirat, son of Poet Bhika, besides being a poet, had the privilege of being an enrolled soldier in the army of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru. When it came to writing hymns he chose to praise Guru Amar Das and Guru Ram Das, writing four praises each for them, totalling eight. He was the son of Poet Bhika, and brother of Poets Mathura and Jalap."
