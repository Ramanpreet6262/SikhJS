As a child Guru Nanak spent most of his time in isolation and meditation. He slept only for a few hours, ate small quantities of food and spoke little. One day he disappeared while having his morning bath and reappeared 3 days later and said: There is no Hindu and there is no Muslim. By saying this he meant that titles were meaningless because all of humanity is one and the light of God shines within everyone."

His father was named Pheru and worked as a small businessman. Bhai Lehna always did everything that Guru Nanak asked, which is why Guru Nanak renamed Bhai Lehna as his Ang or limb of his body. Guru Angad Dev simplified the old Punjabi characters into a new alphabet, called Gurmukhi. He thus gave the people the gift of literature. He took great interest in the education of children and opened several schools."

His hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib reflect his dedication to the Name of Hari (God) which he describes as: cure for all ills of the world. Saint Bhikhan was the most learned man of the time of Moghul Emperor Akbar. For many years, he was engaged in teaching and instructing people. He stated that this spiritual succession was from Mir Saiyid Ibrahim of Irij. He left several children who were adorned with piety, wisdom, knowledge and virtue.

It is written that Saint Dhana asked a Brahmin about God who gave him a stone to worship. Dhana offered food and milk to the stone, and refused to eat till God accepted his food.

    "description": "Saint Trilochan [1267 - ?], a name which literally means three-eyed, the seer of the present, past and future, was a celebrated saint of the Hindu Vaishya caste. There are four hymns by him in the Guru Granth Sahib, in which he has condemned superficial rituals and pretentious renunciation and stressed the holiness of the heart. Saint Trilochan always gave more importance to love and devotion in preference to selfish interests. He believed that he who is always occupied with problems relating to wealth and property would never become happy. He always served the saints at his residence with the utmost dedication and humility. The exact place of birth of Bhagat Trilochan is not known. Some historians claim its Barsi near Sholapur, Maharastra and others claim its Uttar Pradesh. But it is an accepted fact that he spent most of his time in Maharashtra. The fact that two hymns of Saint Kabir constitute a dialogue between Saint Namdev and Saint Trilochan shows that these two saints were friends, and in fact it was Namdev who introduced Trilochan to his Guru who showed him the way to God."

His writings about God are full of love and devotion, very direct and striking in appeal. The birth of Kabir remains to this day shrouded in mystery and legend. Authorities disagree on both when he was born and who his parents were. One legend proclaims a divine virginal birth. His mother was reputed to have been of the Brahman caste and to have become pregnant after a visit to a Hindu shrine. Because she was unwed, she abandoned Kabir, who was found and adopted by a Muslim weaver. That his early life began as a Muslim there is no doubt, although he later became influenced by the Hindu ascetic, Ramananda, who he accepted as his Guru."

He was born at Gagaraun, in the present day Jhalawar district of Rajasthan and was a devotee of the Goddess Bhavani whose idol was enshrined in a temple within the premises of his palace. The Goddess, it is said, once told him in a dream to visit Varanasi and receive initiation from Saint Ramanand. Pipa went to Varanasi, but Saint Ramanand refused to see him in his gaudy robes. Pipa cast off his royal apparel and put on poor ones, after which he was initiated and began to live like an ascetic. At his invitation, Saint Ramanand visited Gagaraun, and King Pipa lent his shoulder to the palanquin carrying Ramanand in a procession. Pipa now finally decided to give up his throne and retire to a life of seclusion and meditation. He went to Dwarka where Lord Krishna, after the Mahabharata, had spent the last years of his life. All the twelve wives of Pipa insisted on accompanying him, but he took along only one, named Sita, who had a spiritual inclination. He selected a cave for his residence from where he daily walked through a tunnel to the temple of Lord Krishna on the sea coast. The temple is still a popular place of pilgrimage and a fair is held there annually in the memory of Saint Pipa."
