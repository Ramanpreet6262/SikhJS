Plans
==

Until v0.5.0, project was still finding right way to progress and took immature decisions.
However, since then, the philosophy is as follows:

* Add/Modify dependencies in even dot versions.
* Add/Improve features in odd dot versions.
* Fix bugs in dot dot versions.
* Major versions would be collection of above dot versions with some major changes. So x.9 -> x+1.0 would usually take a lot of time.
* Future versions will always have potential feature list which can change based on schedule and the awkwardness of being at x.8.0 and still having loads of work until x+1.0.0.

Though we try our best to follow the guideline, but then, we're humans. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
