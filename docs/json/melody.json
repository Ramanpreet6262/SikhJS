This affection arises from knowledge, common sense and a detailed study. There is therefore an understanding and a considered will to devote itself to that entity."},{"id":59,"melody":"Parbhati Dakhani","gurmukhi":"\u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a24\u0a40 \u0a26\u0a16\u0a23\u0a40","description":"The nature of Parbhati Dakhani is very similar to that of Parbhati, except that the feelings of devotion are more disciplined. This discipline arises from the South Indian style of expression of this Raag."},{"id":60,"melody":"Bibhas Parbhati","gurmukhi":"\u0a2c\u0a3f\u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a38 \u0a2a\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a24\u0a40","description":"Bibhas Parbhati has a self-assured character and has a sense of certainty, which arises from the knowledge gained through awareness. It conveys the wisdom achieved from learning, which inspires contentment. However, this wisdom is not arrogant, but is gentle in its persuasion because there is not a need to \u2018show-off\u2019 this knowledge, but a desire to share it, so the recipient is able to learn."},{"id":61,"melody":"Jaijavanti","gurmukhi":"\u0a1c\u0a48\u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a35\u0a70\u0a24\u0a40","description":"Jaijavanti expresses the feeling of happiness and satisfaction of achievement, however it simultaneously conveys the sadness of losing. An apt simile for this Raag is that of a king winning a battle, however he is then told that his son has perished on the battlefield. This Raag conveys a sense of having to put your duty first, no matter what your inner feelings may be. The duality of the emotions of joy and sorrow help to keep you stable and prevent you revelling in your own achievement."}]
