By saying this he meant that titles were meaningless because all of humanity is one and the light of God shines within everyone."

The first time that this ceremony took place was on Baisakhi, which fell on 30 March 1699 at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab, India. The word \"Khalsa\" is derived from Arabic khalis (literally meaning \"pure\" or \"unsullied\") and Perso-Arabic khalisah (literally pure; office of revenue department; lands directly under government management), is used collectively for the community of baptised Sikhs.
