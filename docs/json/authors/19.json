  "description":"Saint Sain [14th - 15th Century], whose one hymn has been included in the Guru Granth Sahib, is counted among the disciples of the famous Saint Ramanand. Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, says in one of his hymns that Sain means a devotee with rare devotion. In another hymn, he refers to him as an example of dedication to the service of holymen.<br\/><br\/>Saint Ravidas in one his hymns, ranks Saint Sain as the same as Saint Namdev, Saint Kabir, Saint Trilochan and Saint Sadhana in terms of virtue. All accounts agree that Sain was a barber, some stating that he served at the court of Raja Ram, King of Rewa, then called Bandhavgarh, while others hold that he was attached to the court of the ruler of Bidar in South India.
