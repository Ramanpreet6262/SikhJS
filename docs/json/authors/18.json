  "description":"Saint Bhikhan [1480 - 1573] is a medieval Hindu saint, two of whose hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib. There are in fact two saints of that time sharing the same name - Bhakta Bhikhan and Bhikhan the Sufi. Bhakta Bhikhan was a devotee in the tradition of Saint Ravidas and Saint Dhana, born at Kakori near Lucknow in present day Uttar Pardesh. His hymns in the Guru Granth S\u00e3hib reflect his dedication to the Name of Hari (God) which he describes as: cure for all ills of the world.<br\/><br\/>Saint Bhikhan was the most learned man of the time of Moghul Emperor Akbar. For many years, he was engaged in teaching and instructing people. He stated that this spiritual succession was from Mir Saiyid Ibrahim of Irij. He left several children who were adorned with piety, wisdom, knowledge and virtue. The hymns of Saint Bhikan resemble those of Saint Sheikh Farid."
