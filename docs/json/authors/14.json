  "description":"Saint Dhana [1415 - 1475], whose three hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib, was born to a poor Hindu farmer family of Jat caste in the village of Dhuan Kalan located in the Tonk region of Rajasthan. From his very childhood, Saint Dhana was very simple, hardworking and innocent. He enjoyed being in the company of saints and scholars and soon became a follower of the famous Saint Ramanand.<br\/><br\/>It is written that Saint Dhana asked a Brahmin about God who gave him a stone to worship. Dhana offered food and milk to the stone, and refused to eat till God accepted his food. Through this innocent love and pure devotion, God appeared before him and the fields Dhana was going to plow with seeds, began to produce grains without them."
