  "description":"Guru Gobind Singh ji (Friday, January 5, 16661, in Patna, Bihar, India - Thursday, 21 October, 1708) was born \"Gobind Rai\" and was the tenth and last of the ten human form Gurus of Sikhism. He became Guru on November 24, 1675 at the age of nine, following in the footsteps of his father Guru Teg Bahadur ji.<br \/> before Guru ji left his mortal body for his heavenly abode, he nominated Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji (SGGS) as the next perpetual Guru of the Sikhs. Guru Gobind Singh molded the Sikh religion into its present shape, with the formation of the Khalsa fraternity and completion of the Guru Granth Sahib as we find it today, which some will say was his greatest act.
