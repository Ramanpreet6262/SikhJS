  "description":"Saint Parmanand [1483 - ?], a Hindu Maharashtrian poet, one of whose hymns is included in the Guru Granth Sahib, is believed to have resided at Barsi, situated to the north of Pandharpur, in present day Sholapur district of Maharashtra. Parmanand was a devotee of Lord Vishnu and wrote his songs in the Indian classical melody of Sarang, which is the mood of a rain bird who is ever thirsty for a rain drop. Similarly, Saint Parmanand always longed for God whom he worshipped in the Vaishnavite manifestation of Lord Krishna. He used to make, it is said, seven hundred bows daily to God on his uncovered, often bleeding, knees."
