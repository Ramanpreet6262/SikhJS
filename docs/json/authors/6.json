  "description":"Guru Angad Dev [1504 - 1552], originally called Bhai Lehna, was born at Harike, a small village in the Ferozepur district. His father was named Pheru and worked as a small businessman. <br\/><br\/>Bhai Lehna always did everything that Guru Nanak asked, which is why Guru Nanak renamed Bhai Lehna as his Ang or limb of his body.<br\/><br\/>Guru Angad Dev simplified the old Punjabi characters into a new alphabet, called Gurmukhi. He thus gave the people the gift of literature. He took great interest in the education of children and opened several schools."
