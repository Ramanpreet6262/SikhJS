  "description":"Poet Balh [15th - 16th Century] was part of a group of eleven poets and singers known as Bhatts, who were all Vaishnavites, followers of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna, who had come to the congregation of Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, seeking spiritual solace.<br\/><br\/>Poet Balh wrote five hymns in praise of Guru Ram Das, the fourth Guru. The favourite subject of his hymns has been the transmigration of the soul and continuity of the divine light from one Guru to the other."
