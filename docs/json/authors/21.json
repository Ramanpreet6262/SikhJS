  "description": "Saint Sheikh Farid [? - 1552], also known as Baba Farid, Sheikh Brahm or Farid Sani, was the tenth successor to the famous Fariduddin Shakarganj [1173 - 1266], a Muslim Sufi of the Chishti Sufi order who was the first major poet of the Punjabi language. Saint Sheikh Farid met Guru Nanak Dev in Pakpattan, where a disciple of the Sheikh had overheard Guru Nanak, along with his two disciples Bhai Bala and Mardana, singing hymns about God. The disciple went to his master, Saint Sheikh Farid, and at once upon hearing the hymn from his disciple he set off to meet Guru Nanak himself, which gave him the peace and joy he was looking for."
