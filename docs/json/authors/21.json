  "description":"Saint Sadhana [12th - 13th Century], was a butcher by profession who, through his devotion, had gained enlightenment. He is believed to have been born at the village of Sehvan, in Sindh and cremated at Sirhind, in the Punjab, where even today a tomb stands in his memory. Saint  Sadhana is believed to have lived during the time of Saint Namdev.<br\/><br\/>Saint Sadhana lived by selling meat, though, it is believed, he never butchered the animals himself. His only hymn in the Guru Granth Sahib written in melody Bilaval indicates his belief that all evil deeds of a man - or even a butcher - could be washed away by devoted meditation on the Name of God."
