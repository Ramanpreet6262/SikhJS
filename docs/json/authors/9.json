  "description":"Saint Beni [15th - 16th Century] was a Hindu mystic whose teachings have been incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. It is believed he spent most of his time in prayer and meditation, and often neglected his household needs - so God himself intervened and physically appeared to help him several times.<br\/><br\/>Saint Beni has three hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib marked by an intense spiritual longing. They also indicate the various paths tried by him in his quest, his practical experience of life and his mastery of religious lore of diverse traditions."
