  "description":"Khalsa Panth is the collective body of all initiated Sikhs represented by the five beloved-ones and can be called the Guru Panth, the embodiment of the Guru, and the final temporal Guru/leader of the Sikhs along with Guru Granth, the mind of Guru. The first time that this ceremony took place was on Baisakhi, which fell on 30 March 1699 at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab, India. The word \"Khalsa\" is derived from Arabic khalis (literally meaning \"pure\" or \"unsullied\") and Perso-Arabic khalisah (literally pure; office of revenue department; lands directly under government management), is used collectively for the community of baptised Sikhs.
